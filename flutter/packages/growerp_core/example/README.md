# example

An example package for the GrowERP core package.

It uses the local backend system
    from https://github.com/growerp/growerp/moqui

You can also use our test backend system 
    set in: example/assets/cfg/app_settings.json
        databaseUrlDebug: https://test.growerp.org

This package just shows the main menu and provides core functionality to the other growerp_* packages
