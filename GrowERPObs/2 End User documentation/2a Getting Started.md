if you want to use the system as an **end User**, try our demo installation or our production environment to see if the system is for you. You can use this system on a PC or on your mobile. More information at the [end user section](https://www.growerp.com/#/../end_user/getStarted).  
You can create your own website or start selling in minutes with a simple registration!

If you are a **developer** we offer you 2 environments:

1.  The API interface for your own developed frontend
2.  Our use/modify our Flutter frontend.

Or run it all yourself; both frontend and backend are open source.
